Hi,

I'm a data scientist with 2+ years of professional experience. I recently completed Le Wagon's intensive Data Science & AI Bootcamp where I learned new skills including project experience in the fields of Deep Learning and Generative AI and improved myself as a data scientist. I'm looking forward to the next step in my career where I can contribute my knowledge and creativity to data-driven problem solving.

I use this space to share some of my own projects that I complete based on publicly available datasets to showcase what I can provide to a data team.
