Hi,

  I'm a mechanical engineer with 7+ years of professional experience in mechanical design and simulation.
After learning the fundamentals of machine learning to use on a project, I discovered a passion for data science and all of the exciting opportunities it provides.

I'm currently looking for an opportunity to learn new skills and contribute my knowledge and creativity to data-driven problem solving.

I will use this space to share some of the projects I complete to showcase what I have learned.
