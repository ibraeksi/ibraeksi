Hi,

I'm a data scientist with 2+ years of professional experience. I'm currently attending Le Wagon intensive Data Science Bootcamp and looking for an opportunity to learn new skills and contribute my knowledge and creativity to data-driven problem solving.

I use this space to share some of my own projects that I complete based on publicly available datasets to showcase what I can provide to a data team.
